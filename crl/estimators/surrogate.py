"""Frozen-reference surrogate estimator (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED — by design).

Intended approach (CPO-style, Achiam et al. 2017): at the start of each
phase collect one batch per past task under the frozen reference policy,
fit advantages once, and evaluate the constraint as an expectation over
that fixed batch in which the learner enters only through likelihood
ratios. Exact at the phase start (theta^(0) = phi_bar, eq 2), valid nearby
under a trust region / clipping.

Whether to build this, the replay + truncated-importance-weight (V-trace)
variant, or per-task fitted critics is an open project decision with
paper-level consequences; see HANDOFF.md ("Rollout cost") and ask Protik
before implementing. The interface below fixes the plug-in point so the
trainer needs no changes when a choice lands.
