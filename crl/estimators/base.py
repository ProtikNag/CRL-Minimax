"""Value-estimation interface.

Everything the trainer needs from a backend is two operations:

* ``evaluate``           -- a scalar estimate of V_i^pi (no autograd graph),
                            used for constraint values F-hat (eqs 7, 11) and
                            frozen references.
* ``surrogate_objective``-- a differentiable scalar whose gradient is an
                            estimate of grad V_i^pi (eqs 17-19 / 21-23), used
                            to assemble the primal updates (eqs 20, 24).

Swapping backends (exact DP, Monte-Carlo rollouts, and later replay-based or
frozen-reference surrogates) changes nothing in the trainer.
