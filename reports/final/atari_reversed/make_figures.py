"""Finalised paper figures, line 1: the reversed five-game Atari sequence.

Two figures only, both on the reversed order SpaceInvaders -> Boxing -> Breakout
-> Pong -> Q*bert. Order sensitivity is acknowledged in the paper as an observed
phenomenon and its analysis is out of scope, so the canonical-order variants are
not rebuilt here.

Differences from ``reports/order_sensitivity`` (the exploratory version):

* The method is named **Min-Max** everywhere. The internal "V5" label is gone.
* The retention colour scale is **clamped at the ceiling**. Anything at or above
  100% of the Joint ceiling renders as the same blue, so a well-retained 82% is
  no longer dragged toward red by a 360% outlier at the top of the old scale.
* **No in-figure titles.** Papers carry the caption in LaTeX; a title baked into
  the artwork duplicates it and is dropped at typesetting time anyway.
* Raw scores are redrawn as bars against a **drawn ceiling rule** rather than
  four undifferentiated bars with rotated tick labels.

Data is read from ``reports/order_sensitivity/data.json`` and is not duplicated;
that file remains the single transcription of the cluster eval matrices.
